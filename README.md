# note_quizzer
One principle of learning is that "recall" is better than "review." This is why being quizzed on material (such as through flashcards) is more helpful than rereading notes. This program uses NLP to locate noun phrases in a set of notes and randomly blanks them out so the user is forced to recall information when rereading notes

Note that the program will work even if notes are not written in full sentences
